# Hotel system management crated with MS Access (University requirements)

The main purpose of the database is to store information about reservations for stays at the fictitious D&B&N hotel chain. The chain consists of two hotels: hotel Bursztyn i Zielony ZakÄ…tek. However, under the term reservations are taken reservations made, and reservations canceled. In addition, the presented database also performs side functions such as:
<ul>
<li>storing information on current room statuses and room types</li>
<li>storing information on employees</li>
<li>collecting and storing information on guests</li>
<li>collecting and storing information on transactions made and payment methods</li>
<li>generating reports on the number of guests, completed and canceled reservations at each hotel</li>
<li>generating invoices</li>
</ul>

As an attachment, I attached a logical model and relations between the tables.
